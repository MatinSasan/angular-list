### Instruction

This simple app, demanded as a test for an interview, has been deployed on Firebase as well as being able to run on development server (localhost:4200) through Docker (using `docker-compose`). 

  
  
### Main files 

Located in: 

- src/app/app.module.ts (where necessary imports for animations were added)
- src/app/person.model.ts (where model is added)
- src/app/table/ (where the main logic and template for demanded task is coded)  

  
  
  
### Update  
Added `Extra Task` with route of `/extra` with another table capable of sorting and showing a card in form of dialog by click, page-not-found page, and dialog page.  
Used Angular Material (Animations, Card, Dialog) and generated mat-table.
